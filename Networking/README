How to start the application
============================
1. The server part is supposed to be started as a Java Application
2. Main is used to simulate three clients which connect to the server on port 4444

Protocol used for communication:
Client sends two separate messages to the server of the form:
1. "<client " + name + "> Hello Server"
2. "<client " + name + "> By Server"
Server responds with:
1. "<server> Hello!\n"
2. "<server> Bye!\n"

When a "<server> Bye!" message is encoutered on client side, the client closes the connection to the server.
